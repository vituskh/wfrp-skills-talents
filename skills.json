		"type": "Advanced",
		"characteristic": "Intelligence",
		"description": "Use Academic Knowledge to remember pertinent facts and figures, and (if you have access to the proper facilities or resources) to do research. Academic Knowledge represents a depth of learning far beyond Common Knowledge and requires extensive study. Academic Knowledge is unusual in that it is not one skill, but many and each must be acquired individually. Each Academic Knowledge skill is a separate field of study, with the specialty noted in parenthesis. For example, Academic Knowledge (Religion) is a different skill than Academic Knowledge (History). The most common Academic Knowledge skills are the Arts, Astronomy, Daemonology, Engineering, Genealogy/Heraldry, History, Law, Magic, Necromancy, Philosophy, Runes, Science, Strategy/Tactics, and Theology."
